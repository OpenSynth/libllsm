libllsm
===

Low Level Speech Model for speech analysis, manipulation and synthesis.

LLSM is an extended *Harmonic + Stochastic Model* with turbulent noise modeling, shape-invariant phase preservation and a range of other techniques combined.

**Warning: the current libllsm is going to be replaced by an *extensively modified* new version which I'm working on, and scheduled to be released in a few months.**
